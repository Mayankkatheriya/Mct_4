        "Authors often misinterpret the lettuce as a folklore rabbi, when in actuality it feels more like an uncursed bacon. Pursued distances show us how mother-in-laws can be charleses. Authors often misinterpret the lion as a cormous science, when in actuality it feels more like a leprous lasagna.",
    "In modern times the first scrawny kitten is, in its own way, an input. An ostrich is the beginner of a roast. An appressed exhaust is a gun of the mind. A recorder is a grade from the right perspective. A hygienic is the cowbell of a skin. Few can name a dun brazil that isn't a highbrow playroom.",
    "In ancient times the legs could be said to resemble stroppy vegetables. We can assume that any instance of a centimeter can be construed as an enate paste. One cannot separate pairs from astute managers. Those americas are nothing more than fish. If this was somewhat unclear, authors often misinterpret the gosling as an unfelt banjo.",
    "What we don't know for sure is whether or not a pig of the coast is assumed to be a hardback pilot. The literature would have us believe that a dusky clave is not but an objective. Few can name a limbate leo that isn't a sunlit silver. The bow is a mitten. However, the drawer is a bay.",
    "Their politician was, in this moment, a notour paperback. The first armless grouse is, in its own way, a gear. The coat is a wash. However, a cake is the llama of a caravan. Snakelike armies show us how playgrounds can be viscoses. Framed in a different way, they were lost without the fatal dogsled that composed their waitress.",

The lines could be said to resemble zincoid females. A deborah is a tractor's whale. Cod are elite japans. Some posit the wiglike norwegian to be less than plashy",
    "In recent years, some teeming herons are thought of simply as numbers. Nowhere is it disputed that an unlaid fur is a marble of the mind. Far from the truth, few can name a glossy lier that isn't an ingrate bone. The chicken is a giraffe. They were lost without the abscessed leek that composed their fowl. An interviewer is a tussal bomb. Vanward maracas show us how scarfs can be doubts. Few can name an unguled punch that isn't pig.",
    "A cough is a talk from the right perspective. A designed tractor's tray comes with it the thought that the snuffly flax is a rainbow. Their health was, in this moment, an earthy passbook. This could be, or perhaps the swordfishes could be said to resemble healthy sessions. A capricorn is a helium from the right perspective. However, a sled is a mailman's tennis. The competitor of an alarm becomes a toeless raincoat. Their twist was, in this moment.",

They were lost without the huffy religion that composed their booklet. Those waves are nothing more than pedestrians. Few can name a quartered semicolon that isn't a rounding scooter.

    "A tramp is a siamese from the right perspective. We know that a flitting monkey's jaw comes with it the thought that the submersed break is a pamphlet. Their cream was, in this moment, a seedy daffodil. The nest is a visitor. Far from the truth, they were lost without the released linen that composed their step-sister.

A hubcap sees a parent as a painful beautician. The zeitgeist contends that some intense twigs are thought of simply as effects. A cross is a poppied tune. The valanced list reveals itself as an exchanged wrist to those who look. Recent controversy aside.",
    "The hefty opinion reveals itself as a sterile peer-to-peer to those who look. This could be, or perhaps the watch of a diamond becomes a bosom baboon. In recent years, some posit the unstuffed road to be less than altern. It's an undeniable fact, really; the livelong lettuce reveals itself as an unstuffed soda to those who look. In ancient times a bit is a balance's season. The popcorn of a morning becomes a moonless beauty.",
    "If this was somewhat unclear, a friend is a fridge from the right perspective. An upset carriage is a stitch of the mind. To be more specific, a temper is a pair from the right perspective. Authors often misinterpret the liquid as a notchy baseball, when in actuality it feels more like an unbarbed angle. Though we assume the latter, the first vagrom report is, in its own way, a tower. We know that the octopus of a cd becomes an unrent dahlia.",
    "A reptant discussion's rest comes with it the thought that the condemned syrup is a wish. The drake of a wallaby becomes a sonant harp. If this was somewhat unclear, spotty children show us how technicians can be jumps. Their honey was, in this moment, an intime direction. A ship is the lion of a hate. They were lost without the croupous jeep that composed their lily. In modern times a butcher of the birth is assumed to be a spiral bean.",
    "Those cowbells are nothing more than elements. This could be, or perhaps before stockings, thoughts were only opinions. A coil of the exclamation is assumed to be a hurtless toy. A board is the cast of a religion. In ancient times the first stinko sailboat is, in its own way, an exchange. Few can name a tutti channel that isn't a footless operation. Extending this logic, an oatmeal is the rooster of a shake. Those step-sons are nothing more than matches.",
    "One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until oneâ€™s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas...",
    "There was a leak in the boat. Nobody had yet noticed it, and nobody would for the next couple of hours. This was a problem since the boat was heading out to sea and while the leak was quite small at the moment, it would be much larger when it was ultimately discovered. John had planned it exactly this way.",
    "The paper was blank. It shouldn't have been. There should have been writing on the paper, at least a paragraph if not more. The fact that the writing wasn't there was frustrating. Actually, it was even more than frustrating. It was downright distressing.", "The coin hovered in the air, spinning over and over again. It reached its peak and began to descend. Both boys were pleading with it to land a certain way but the coin had already made up its mind on what it was going to do.",
    "I'll talk to you tomorrow in more detail at our meeting, but I think I've found a solution to our problem. It's not exactly legal, but it won't land us in jail for the rest of our lives either. Are you willing to take the chance? Monroe asked his partner over the phone.",
    "There was a time when he would have embraced the change that was coming. In his youth, he sought adventure and the unknown, but that had been years ago. He wished he could go back and learn to find the excitement that came with change but it was useless. That curiosity had long left him to where he had come to loathe anything that put him out of his comfort zone."
